# ðŸ“Š Sales Data Analysis with Microsoft Excel

This repository contains my submission for the **"Introduction to Data Analysis using Microsoft Excel"** guided project from **Coursera**.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

In this project, I learned and applied foundational data analysis techniques using Microsoft Excel. The data used is sales data from a sample company, and I explored various Excel features to analyze and summarize it effectively.

## ðŸ”§ Key Excel Skills Practiced

- Data **sorting** and **filtering**
- Use of **IF** and **VLOOKUP** functions
- Creation and analysis of **PivotTables**
- Summarizing monthly and regional sales data
- Generating meaningful insights from structured data

## ðŸ“‚ Files in This Repository

- `sales_data_analysis.xlsx`: Main Excel workbook used for data analysis
- `README.md`: Project documentation (you are here)

## ðŸ“ˆ PivotTable Insights

The workbook includes multiple PivotTables such as:
- **Monthly Regional Sales Summary** (North, South, West)
- **Brand-wise Sales in North Region**

These PivotTables provide a clear view of how sales vary by month, region, and product brand.
